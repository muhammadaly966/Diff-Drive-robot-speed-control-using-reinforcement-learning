In order for the models with path planning simulink block to work. You must install the Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox from MATLAB.<br>

This can be done by two ways:<br>

1) Install ther toolbox from the file called Mobile Robots Toolbox found in the current folder.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
2) You can install it from MATLAB using the following procedures:<br>
	a) Go to HOME tab in MATLAB<br>
	b) From Enviroment click the Add-Ons icon<br>
	c) Type the name of the library "Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox"<br>
	d) click Install<br>
	e) Now, you can run ALL models<br>
<br>
Here is the link of the library: <br>
